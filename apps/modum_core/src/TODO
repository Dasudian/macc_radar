ant docs
--------
- start at begin of link or node
- antState contains position, which is the resource and position on that resource on which the ant has to execute its current scenario, e.g. {link1, begin}
- antState contains time, at which the state is valid, e.g. at which the vehicle is on the given position
- antState contains boundaryCondition, which is set in createScenario and determines when the scenario is finished. should be a tuple {resource, position}, e.g {node_out, begin}
- history contains a previously executed scenarios
- ant record contains hop limit

Erlang rules
------------
http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml
- Use functions for interfaces whenever possible, avoid sending messages directly. Encapsulate message passing into interface functions. There are cases where you can't do this. The message protocol is internal information and should be hidden to other modules.
- Use tagged return values, e.g. {value, Value}.
- Choose meaningful variable names - this is very difficult. If a variable name consists of several words, use "_" or a capitalized letter to separate them. Example: My_variable or MyVariable.
- Avoid using "_" as don't care variable, use variables beginning with "_" instead. Example: _Name.
